# Informal Systems

Welcome to our Github!

Informal Systems is an employee-owned organization working on a ton of open-source software, 
with particular emphasis on the [Cosmos Ecosystem](https://cosmos.network/). 
But we're also pushing the boundary on making formal methods software more accessible to developers. 

See below for an index of some of our work on [Cosmos](#Cosmos) and on [Formal Methods](#formal-methods)!

## Cosmos

We believe the Cosmos values of sovereignty and interoperability are essential to the birth and growth of a healthy interchain economy.
We're proud to play a key role in bringing nurturing the interchain as stewards of core pieces of the Cosmos stack,
including [CometBFT](https://cometbft.com)
and the [Cosmos Hub](https://hub.cosmos.network/). 

Some of the software we steward is located in other Github organizations:

- [CometBFT](https://github.com/cometbft)
- [Cosmos Hub](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia)
- [Interchain Security](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security)

In our Github org, you can find:

- [tendermint-rs] - rust libraries for interacting with tendermint or CometBFT
- [hermes] - industry leading IBC relayer software
- [atomkraft] - advanced fuzz testing for Cosmos applications
- [multisig] - manage multisigs across many keys and chains
- [stakooler] - simplify accounting for staking rewards
- [basecoin-rs] - simple rust application built with ABCI and IBC
- [cosmos.nix] - Nix integration with Cosmos projects
- [gm] - manage local gaiad instances - without docker
- [tm-load-test] - load testing for tendermint or CometBFT

## Formal Methods

We believe that formal specification is critical to improving the quality of software development and we are committed to making formal
methods more accessible to the average developer.

We lead development of Apalache, a symbolic model checker for TLA+, designed to make TLA+ tooling more delightful for engineers.

We also developed Quint, an alternative syntax for TLA+, designed to make writing specifications an absolute delight! Check out our formal methods work below:

- [Apalache] - symbolic model checker for TLA+
- [Quint] - a delightful specification language with modern tooling
- [Modelator] - an engine for model-based testing

[Quint]: https://github.com/informalsystems/quint
[Modelator]: https://github.com/informalsystems/modelator

We leverage our tools to perform industry leading audits on blockchain software. [Contact us](https://informal.systems/services/security-audits) for an audit today!

## Organizational Tools

Occasionally we'll build other tools to improve our internal processes

- [themis-contract] - legal contracting for developers
- [unclog] - avoid merge conflicts when building your changelogs
