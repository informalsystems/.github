# Informal Systems

Welcome to our Github!

Informal Systems is an employee-owned organization working on lots of open-source software, 
with particular emphasis on the [Cosmos Ecosystem](https://cosmos.network/). 
We're also pushing the boundary on making formal methods software more accessible to developers. 

See below for an index of some of our work on [Cosmos](#Cosmos) and on [Formal Methods](#formal-methods)!

## Cosmos

We believe the Cosmos values of sovereignty and interoperability are essential to a healthy interchain economy.
We're proud to play a key role in nurturing the interchain as stewards of core pieces of the Cosmos stack,
including [CometBFT](https://cometbft.com)
and the [Cosmos Hub](https://hub.cosmos.network/). 

Some of the software we steward is located in other Github organizations:

- [CometBFT](https://github.com/cometbft)
- [Cosmos Hub](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia)
- [Interchain Security](https://github.com/cosmos/interchain-security)

In our Github org, you can find:

- [tendermint-rs] - rust libraries for interacting with tendermint or CometBFT
- [hermes] - industry leading IBC relayer software
- [cosmwasm-to-quint] - advanced fuzz testing for CosmWasm applications
- [multisig] - manage multisigs across many keys and chains
- [stakooler] - simplify accounting for staking rewards
- [basecoin-rs] - simple rust application built with ABCI and IBC
- [cosmos.nix] - Nix integration with Cosmos projects
- [gm] - manage local gaiad instances - without docker
- [tm-load-test] - load testing for tendermint or CometBFT

## Formal Methods

We believe that formal specification is critical to improving the quality of software development and we are committed to making formal
methods more accessible to the average developer with delightful tooling.

We built Quint, a specification language designed to delight engineers. Quint builds on the semantics of the widely adopted TLA+ language but introduces modern syntax and tooling that is more familiar to, and usable by, everyday software engineers.

We also built Apalache, a symbolic model checker for TLA+ and Quint, enabling advanced invariant checking for specifications.

- [Quint] - a delightful specification language with modern tooling
- [Apalache] - symbolic model checker for TLA+

We leverage our tools to perform industry leading audits on blockchain software. [Contact us](https://informal.systems/services/security-audits) for an audit today!

## Organizational Tools

Occasionally we'll build other tools to improve our internal processes

- [themis-contract] - legal contracting for developers
- [unclog] - avoid merge conflicts when building your changelogs
